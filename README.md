# TriPeaks
TriPeaks is a modern clone of the TriPeaks game from the Microsoft Entertainment pack for Windows 3.1, written in C# .NET and WPF.  
The original programs are 16 bit programs and don't run under newer Windows versions or on any 64 bit Windows versions.

Originally the game was supposed to be as close to the orginal program as possible, but now the goal is to modernise the game while keeping the rules of the original.

## Requirements
This program uses the .NET Framework 4.5.

To compile it, you need Visual Studio 2015 or any C# 6.0 compiler.  
The project file itself is VS2012 compatible.

## License
The program is licensed under the MIT license. See the license file (`LICENSE`) for details.
