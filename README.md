# TriPeaks
This program is a clone of the TriPeaks from the Microsoft Entertainment pack for Windows 3.1, written in C# .NET and WPF.  
The original programs are 16 bit programs and don't run under newer Windows versions or on any 64 bit Windows versions.

It strives to be as close to the original program as possible. The only exception are the game graphics and assets of course, as they are still copyrighted by Microsoft.

## Requirements
To run and compile the program, .NET 4.5 is required.  
The program was written with Visual Studio 2013, although 2012 should also work.

It could theoretically run under earlier versions of the .NET Framework, but then you'd lose all asynchronicity, and the code makes use of TPL & async quite a bit.

## Licence
The program is licenced under the MIT licence. See the license file for details.
